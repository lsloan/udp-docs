UDP & UCDM Documentation

## Viewing the Documentation
To view the UDP documentation in this repository as rendered pages rather than as HTML source, go to:

* https://rawgit.com/unizin/udp-docs/master/udp/index.html

That uses the [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) service to view a "development" version of the documentation.  If you need to view the documentation in a different branch or fork, change the URL as needed.
